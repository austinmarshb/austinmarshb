## Hey 👋

Thanks for stopping by. Here is some stuff about me.

- 🦞 I currently live in Portland, Maine. It's where I'm originally from, but I've also lived in Boston Massachusetts, Denver Colorado, and Portland Oregon!

- 🛠️ I've held a lot of interesting jobs in my life, including being an EMT, a bicycle mechanic, a CDL-A truck driver, a hydraulic knuckle boom crane operator, a VoIP tech, and an eLearning developer! Suddenly I feel old...

- ⚡ Fun fact: My coding journey began with making a video game called, "The Adventures of Sullivan", it was my second coding project ever.

It took me two years and I was really happy to fulfill a lifelong dream of making my own video game. It's what inspired me to pursue a degree and work in programming.
